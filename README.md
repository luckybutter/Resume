# Resume

Greetings!

I am Matt Canoy. https://www.linkedin.com/in/luckybuttermc/

I am glad you have found my resume App. Can you figure out why it's named "Pudding"? :)

(You will need to setup the project via `pod install` from Cocoapods in order for it to run as intended https://cocoapods.org/)

I had a personal goal of creating a resume app for myself with the time constraint of 1 day to force me to try and create this app from start to finish without wiggle room to continuously develop and feature creep it to death. One huge stipulation here, I did not code this exclusively over the course of the day. I spent Memorial day with my girlfriend exercising, cleaning up the apartment, playing video games with her, had a long discussion with the team I am still building other products with and working in the free time. My personal work/life balance is extremely important to me but if there is something that needs to be done I will do it.

It isn't meant to be perfect but to show a general overview of iOS Development Abilities. I would love to talk to you about my approach, things I want to improve/features to add and would love you know your opinion as well as your input on what to improve on.

The architecture is based loosely on Clean Swift https://clean-swift.com/. 

I chose to loosely base the architecture on it as a form of exploration in understanding it for myself while tying in elements of development I have employed in my own work.

I hope you have a great day and feel free to reach out!
