# Resume

Greetings!

I am Matt Canoy. 

I am glad you have found my resume App. 

I had a personal goal of creating a resume app for myself with the time constraint of 1 day to force me to try and create this app from start to finish without wiggle room to continuously develop and feature creep it to death.

It isn't meant to be perfect but to show a general overview of iOS Development Abilities. I would love to talk to you about my approach, things I want to improve/features to add and would love you know your opinion as well as your input on what to improve on.

The architecture is based loosely on Clean Swift https://clean-swift.com/. 

I chose to loosely base the architecture on it as a form of exploration in understanding it for myself while tying in elements of development I have employed in my own work.

I hope you have a great day and feel free to reach out!
